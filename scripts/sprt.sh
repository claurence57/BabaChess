# SPRT (Sequential Probability Ratio Test) between two AdaChess-BB builds.
#
# SPRT decides game after game between two hypotheses on the *true* Elo gap:
#   H0: NEW is stronger than OLD by less than ELO0   -> FAIL
#   H1: NEW is stronger than OLD by at least ELO1    -> PASS
# It stops as soon as one is accepted (or at the max_games cap), controlling
# the false-positive (alpha) / false-negative (beta) rates. This replaces the
# fixed-length A/B whose +-65-80 Elo noise made small gains unmeasurable.
#
# Every game starts from a position in openings/openings.epd and each opening
# is played twice with colours swapped (-repeat): that removes the colour bias
# and decorrelates the games, which SPRT assumes.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/sprt.sh [tc] [elo0] [elo1] [max_games] [seed] [old_engine] [new_engine]
#
#   tc          time control (default 1+0.1); IGNORED when NODES is set
#   elo0, elo1  SPRT bounds in Elo (default 0 and 5)
#   max_games   safety cap, rounded up to an even number (default 2000)
#   old_engine  baseline binary  (default ~/bin/adachess_bb, tag bb-1.0)
#   new_engine  candidate binary (default bin/babachess)
#
# Env overrides: ALPHA (0.05), BETA (0.05), OPENINGS, PROTO (xboard), MAXMOVES (200),
#                NODES (unset)
#
# Fixed-node mode (measure search quality independently of CPU speed):
#   NODES=20000 scripts/sprt.sh 1+0.1 0 5 200 7 old new
#   Pass a placeholder tc (ignored) so the positional arguments stay aligned.
#   When NODES is set, cutechess-cli drives both engines with "nodes=N" per move
#   instead of a time control. The node limit is only honoured by the engine's
#   *UCI* path ("go nodes"), so PROTO defaults to uci in this mode; forcing
#   PROTO=xboard keeps the match but the limit is NOT honoured (the engine would
#   search on its XBoard clock).
#
# Note: to validate a *patch*, pass the previous build as OLD, e.g.
#   scripts/sprt.sh 1+0.1 0 5 2000 7 /tmp/opencode/adachess_bb_p1 bin/babachess
# Comparing directly to the bb-1.0 reference will PASS instantly (gap ~+300).
