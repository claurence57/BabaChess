--  AdaChess-BB : attack tables
--
--  Precomputed attack sets:
--    * Knight_Attacks / King_Attacks / Pawn_Attacks : leapers, table lookups.
--    * Bishop_Attacks / Rook_Attacks : PEXT (BMI2) lookup (one indexed
--      table read); a software fallback is used in the portable build.
--    * Queen_Attacks = Rook_Attacks or Bishop_Attacks.
--
--  All tables are built once at elaboration (deterministic seed). The
--  caller only provides an occupancy bitboard (any subset of the 64 squares).
