--
--  AdaChess-BB : static exchange evaluation (body)
--
--  The sequence is explored over a working copy of the board: each step
--  removes the chosen attacker from its square, removes the piece standing on
--  the target square and settles the attacker on it, then lets the opponent
--  answer. The occupancy is therefore always up to date, which makes x-ray
--  (sliding) attackers appear as soon as the piece in front of them is gone.
--  The sequence is generated forward once (Exchange), then folded backward
--  from the deepest reply with the same "a side may decline" rule the former
--  recursion used.
--
--  The working copy only needs the twelve piece bitboards, the total
--  occupancy and the two colour occupancies: the exchange never looks at the
--  square->piece map, and it always knows which piece stands on the target
--  square (it is the attacker it just settled there). Keeping a dedicated
--  compact record avoids copying the whole Position (clocks, castling rights,
--  key, material, 64-entry square map) on every call.
