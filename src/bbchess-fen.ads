--  AdaChess-BB : FEN loading
--
--  Minimal FEN parser used to set a Position from its Forsyth-Edwards
--  notation. Enough for the perft suite and later for the XBoard "setboard"
--  command.

package BBChess.Fen is

   procedure Load (Position : out Position_Type; Text : in String);
   -- Parse a FEN string into Position. Raises Constraint_Error on garbage
   -- and on illegal positions: the board must contain exactly one king per
   -- side and the side that does not have the move must not be in check.
