--  AdaChess-BB : static evaluation
--
--  Material + piece-square tables, tapered by the game phase (opening /
--  endgame interpolation) and completed by positional terms: bishop pair,
--  piece mobility, rooks on the 7th rank, passed pawns, king safety and
--  king endgame activity. Scores are in centipawns, positive from White's
--  point of view. Every term is evaluated per color and mirrored, so the
--  evaluation is symmetric and returns 0 on the initial position.

   -- antisymmetric under a rank flip + color swap that keeps the same side
   -- to move; the pure antisymmetry holds on Static.
