--  AdaChess-BB : moves and make/unmake
--
--  A move is stored as a small record. Special moves are encoded through
--  the Flag field plus (for promotions) the Promotion field. Make/Unmake
--  keep the position as a plain snapshot: each Make returns an Undo_Info
--  that fully restores the previous state when passed back to Unmake.
--  This makes the position trivially copyable (useful for perft, search
--  and FEN handling).
