--  AdaChess-BB : alpha-beta search
--
--  Iterative deepening with a transposition table, PVS, move ordering
--  (hash move, MVV-LVA captures, killers, history), light LMR, null-move
--  and reverse-futility pruning, a check extension at the horizon and a
--  quiescence search on captures and promotions. Mate/stalemate are
--  detected at the leaves. The timed entry point runs the iteration in
--  aspiration windows around the previous score.

   -- commands): when on, each completed iterative-deepening iteration
   -- prints a line "depth score time nodes bestmove".

   procedure Set_Threads (N : in Natural);
   -- Number of parallel search threads (Lazy SMP). 1 = single threaded.
   -- The transposition table is shared; the heuristics are per thread.

   -- Iterative deepening up to Max_Depth that stops at Time_Alloc. The
   -- search is interruptible (the deadline is polled inside the recursion),
   -- so a move is always returned close to the budget even when a single
   -- iteration would need much longer. Used for XBoard play.

   -- nodes have been visited (0 = no cap). The cap is polled inside the
   -- recursion like the deadline, so a move is returned within one poll
   -- interval of the cap. Used by the UCI "go nodes" command.

   -- Soft/hard time management. Hard_Alloc is the deadline an iteration
   -- already started may not run past (polled inside the recursion, like
   -- Time_Alloc above). Soft_Alloc is the iteration-level target: no new
   -- iteration is started once it is reached, nor when the elapsed time plus
   -- the previous iteration's duration would clearly overshoot it. A single
   -- early iteration is always allowed to run (up to Hard_Alloc). With
   -- Hard_Alloc = 0 the call behaves like the fixed-time entry point.

   procedure Locked_Put_Line (S : in String);
   -- Print one line to standard output under the package-wide console lock.
   -- Ada.Text_IO is not task-safe and the Phase 5 UCI search runs in a task,
   -- so the command loop ("readyok", "bestmove") and the XBoard "post"
   -- iteration reports go through this single lock.

   procedure Reset_Search;
   -- Clear the per-search heuristics (transposition table, killers and
   -- history) between games. The position-independent data must not leak
   -- from one game to the next.

   function Nodes_Searched return Node_Count_Type;
   -- Number of nodes visited since the last Reset_Nodes (or the last timed
   -- search started). Used by the benchmark harness to report nodes/second.

   procedure Reset_Nodes;
   -- Reset the node counter (benchmarking).

   function Transposition_Size_MB return Natural;
